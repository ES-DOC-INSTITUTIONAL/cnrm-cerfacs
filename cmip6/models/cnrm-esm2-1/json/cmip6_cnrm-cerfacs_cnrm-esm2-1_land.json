The FLAKE model simulate surface fluxes over lakes, including both the Caspian and the Aral seas, and computes the temporal evolution of the vertical lake temperature profile from the surface mixing layer to the bottom (Le Moigne et al. 2016). The land surface is represented using the new ISBA-CTRIP coupled system (Decharme et al., 2019; Delire et al. 2019). ISBA calculates the time evolution of the energy, carbon and water budgets at the land surface while CTRIP simulates river discharges (including carbon transport) up to the ocean from the total runoff (and total soil carbon leaching) computed by ISBA."

The land biogeochemical module represents plant physiology (photosynthesis and respiration), carbon allocation and turnover, and carbon cycling through litter and soil (Calvet et al., 1998; Calvet and Soussana, 2001; Gibelin et al., 2006; 2008). Vegetation is represented by 6 biomass pools. Leaf phenology results directly from the carbon balance of the leaves. Leaf area index (LAI) is diagnosed from leaf biomass and specific leaf area index. Wild fires are represented and land-cover changes are resolved following CMIP6 standard. Vegetation distribution is fixed. The vegetation responds to environmental variations by accounting for both CO2 effect on stomatal closure and the CO2 fertilization on vegetation biomass.. The litter and soil organic matter module includes 4 litter carbon pools and 3 soil carbon pools and represents leaching of carbon. Vegetation roughness length and snow-free land surface albedo (Carrer et al. 2014) are specified according to the ECOCLIMAP database (Faroux et al. 2013) while the soil textural properties come from the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO 2012), both at a 1 km resolution.

                "Canopy photosynthesis is represented by the semi-empirical model proposed by Jacobs (1994), based on Goudriaan et al. (1985) and implemented by Calvet et al. (1998). It uses the concept of mesophyll conductance defined in this framework as the rate of photosynthesis under light-saturated conditions (Jacobs et al., 1994). As such, this scheme does not explicitly account for the Michealis-Menten kinetics of the Rubisco enzyme formalized by Farquhar et al. (1980) and Collatz et al. (1992). Goudriaan\u2019s approach was originally chosen by Calvet et al (1998) because it uses conductances instead of enzyme kinetics and was at the time more easily coupled to the existing land surface model. Carbon assimilation is calculated from air CO2 concentration, leaf temperature, solar radiation considering C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathways (Calvet et al., 1998; Gibelin et al., 2006) and the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2, Ci/Ca.  This ratio is affected by the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit from a maximum value at zero deficit to a minimum value for which stomatal closure happens. The maximum value of Ci/Ca is a major parameter of the model. Stomatal conductance is finally deduced from the assimilation rate taking into account cuticular conductance and diffusion competition between H2O and CO2 within the stomatal opening.  No Nitrogen dependency except for an ad-hoc down-regulartion: gross photosynthesis is multiplied by a factor equal to 1 at preindustrial concentration (below CO2ref = 288ppmv) and decreasing with increasing CO2 concentration."

An explicit two-way coupling between ISBA and CTRIP has been set up via the introduction of a standardized coupling interface in SURFEX (Voldoire et al. 2017) with the OASIS3-MCT coupler. This coupling allows to account for, first, a dynamic river flooding scheme in which floodplains interact with the soil and the atmosphere through free-water evaporation, infiltration and precipitation interception and second, a two-dimensional diffusive groundwater scheme to represent unconfined aquifers and upward capillarity fluxes into the superficial soil. CTRIP also transports the soil carbon leaching from ISBA to the ocean."
